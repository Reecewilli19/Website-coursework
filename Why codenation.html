    <h3>WHY I JOINED CODENATION</h3 >
            <p>I joined up with code nation because i can learn a lot about coding and what skills 
            you need to be a successful programmer. I want to learn as much as i can so that i can carry 
            what i learn here throughout the rest of my professional life. I also feel this is a good oppurtunity 
            to learn what companies are looking for in the right candidate and a little bit more about 
            the industry that i hope to enter.
        </p>

    <h3>MY INTERESTS IN CODING & TECHNOLOGY</h3>
        <p>I have a little experience with coding with having being at university for 2 years studying game design
            which primarily focused on coding in C++, and other aspects focusing on the design side. I also have a keen 
            interest in technology with having built my own computer im always looking for new pieces of computer hardware to beef 
            up my preformance. But besides that i am more interested in the new tech that changes the way we live out lives on
            a daily basis.

    <h3>MY GOALS</h3>
        <p>I had a few minor goals that i wanted to achieve but the biggest goal that i wanted to achieve within the first
            week was to learn as much of the basics as i could and expand more and train myself to the point of it being muscle memory.
            i also wanted to have atleast one personal project that i work on with which i could use the things i learnt from this course
            and incorporate them into my personal project.
