            <h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
            <p>Browsing a webpage may be easy for the rest of us but when it comes to people with disabilities it becomes quiet a problem
                with them being able to use a website due to there disabilitie. People who suffer from blindness obviously can not view the display 
                therefore relying on speech prompt to read text aloud for them that is present on the webpage, this system can be composed of 
                screen reading software or a voice synthesizer. most people who suffer from this disability don't use normal browsers like you and me 
                therefore they preferably use nonstandard browsers such as pwWebSpeak or Lynx that use voice output programmes. This also ties into colour
                blindness which results in some people who cant see colour, for example if something is displayed on the website "20% discount on blue items"
                they will not be able to use this. also reading words on the screen may be difficult due to the contrast of the background on certain
                websites.

                People with physical disabilities may find it difficult to use a mouse or keyboard and have to rely on either on to navigate the web,
                on the other hand some people who do suffer from physical disabilites will use adaptive technology with their comeputer to access the web.

            <h3>REVIEWING MY OUTCOME & CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>I felt that the tools that i used for completing my website were easy and simple to use 
                    considering I have never used trello or git hub before. i found it easy to navigate and to understand 
                    exactly what i was achieving by using these tool. I made sure that the tools that I were using. The tools
                    i used were easily accessible by the internet so i didnt have to mess about with downloads.
                    </p>
            <h3>TOOLS USED</h3>
                    <br>
                <h4>Trello</h4>
                    <p>Trello was a useful tool to help organise my work flow and decide exactly
                        how i wanted to tackle the assignment rather than go head first into it without
                        knowing what i wanted the outcome to be. Trello was easy to use and understand 
                        and accessible by internet by signing up for an account. 
                    </p>
                <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
                    <p>This is where i referenced HTML and CSS code for my contents page which i thought 
                        turned out better than hoped for. This was a useful tool as it was accessed by the internet
                        but also you could downlaod it. Bootstrap was useful for the bits that look good in the website 
                        (the contents page) and I'am considering using it more to get used to it. 
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h3>WHAT I COULD OF DONE BETTER</h3>
                    <p>One thing i wanted to do but had no more time was to implement a nav bar
                        with links to my other webpages attached to glyph icons, I thought this would be a cool
                        idea and to access other webpages in my website. I also wanted to format my information on each webpage 
                        better so that it was easily read.
