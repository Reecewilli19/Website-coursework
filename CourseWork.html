    <h3>PURPOSE OF IT IN MODERN BUSINESS</h3>
        <p>IT has had a massive impact on the way business' work when doing daily tasks, for example, voIP or 
            'voice over internet protocol' is being more largely used within business' which some people think will 
            replace legacy phone. Also the use of cloud networking instead of using personal computer networks is much more
            efficient and allows ease of access to files in a office based environment. 
                    
            The industry which i think has
            been affected by the introduction of IT is the marketing industry, This has allowed people
            to develop the SEO or 'search engine optimisation' which ensure's a website can be found using
            key words and phrases which are relevant to what the website offers, so for marketing purposes this method 
            increases website traffic. Another industry that IT is prevelant in is customer service support, the inclusion
            of IT has opened up multiple channels of communication making customer support easily accessible to customers.

    <h3>METHODS, SKILLS & RESOURCES IN DIGITAL PROJECTS</h3>
        <p>There is an exrtensive list of methods to use when planning a digital project, each method has there own technigue and differ
            in the way the work is produced for example agile method and the waterfall method differ in ways where agile is more flexible and often
            works more like a life cycle where as the waterfall method is more linear and the development phase is divided into different phases of
            the project. Waterfall aswell mostly relies on documentation so for example if a person leaves the project and document what has happened during the 
            project then if someone new comes to take his place then they can go through the documentation and see where he left off. Out of the two
            mentioned, waterfall is the more traditional but agile is more commonly used for its more flexible approach.

    <h3>HOW WILL I PLAN AND ORGANISE</h3>
        <p>To plan out my website and other aspects of my coursework i have decided to opt into using a fantastic website called
            Trello, this is a free web-based tool that allows you to create to do lists that can be customised to your specifications and tasks
            that you aim to complete. I have linked my Trello board at the bottom of the page to give you an insight on my way of organising my work.

    <h3>RISKS & CAUSES OF DIGITAL PROJECTS FAILING</h3>
                
        <h4>Faling to account for business processes'</h4>
            <p>This relates to the tools that a development team might use, this might be a reason
                becasue the tool that they think might solve a problem in there development process doesnt adhere to 
                normal protocol in the business' workflow, which then burdens the whole development team into maintaing an 
                insufferable tool that didn't help. 
             </p>
        <h4>Investing in technology for the company and not customer value</h4>
            <p>This normally happens if a company invests in new tech/equipment, lets say a CEO said you should buy, but neglected to fully understand
                whether it is necessary to invest in such equimpment in a business stand point or whether if it's a neccessity to the customer. also to take into 
                account whether you get any return of investment (ROI).
            </p>
                            
    <h4>Poor choice of vendor</h4>
            <p>This is probably the ,ost common of reasons why digital projects tend to fall through, this tends to happen because if your a small client compared
                to what they usually deal with, they may deprioritize your work, but on the other hand you may be a massive client for them and might not be able to
                accommodate what your asking for effectively therefore there being a breakdown between the vendor and the client.
            </p>
                        
    <h4>Overambition</h4>
            <p>The idea of expecting perfection is a downfall for any digital project, and majority of the time 
            people with this frame of mind tend to fail neglecting to consider whether they have took on more than they can 
            chew.
        </p>
            <hr style="border:1px solid gainsboro;">
    <h3>IT SYSTEMS & SOFTWARE & HOW THEY HAVE HELPED</h3>
        <p>There are a wide variety of tools to use to complete tasks with but when wanting to use tools within a business you have to
            evaluate whether that particular software that you want use will be useful for the sort of tasks that you want
            to carry out those tasks. For example if your business revolves around customer service or customer support you may want to invest
            in CRM (customer relationship management) which uses customer data that they have gathered and use it to analys customer behaviour and 
            use that information to improve customer relations. 
        
            For this project i have used Github and Trello which are both extremely useful tools use. Trello has been useful in a way that it helped me 
            to organise and plan out my project before i start it, this made sure that everything was organised and also doubled as a reminder for tasks
            that i may have forgotten about, along with this it helped structure my workflow and helped me to find a rythme.

    <h3>LEGAL BOUNDARIES</h3>
                
    <h4>GDPR</h4>
         <p>GDPR is the protection of citizens in the EU and EEA of their personal data that is stored 
            digitaly, this information includes personal information about yourself, any social mdeia activity, photos, home address 
            and bank account details and statements. A reason why a digital project may suffer from this regulation is the ability of 
            customer engagement, if you delegate all your efforts to providing a GDPR friendly service then like my point in why digital projects fail
            your alogation of resources dedicated to the GDPR compliance may cause your project to fall through. 
         </p>
    <h4>COPYRIGHT</h4>
         <p>Copyright is the term used to something that is owned by right to the person that created the content, this can include literary work, musical works,
            sound recording, dramatic works and graphical and sculptural works. the moment a person copyrights content then
            that is owned by them by law and if someone was to aquire the rights to that content then everything that has been copyrighted under that content
            is under your ownership. The way people can aquire such rights to content will have to pay a fee that is agreed upon by the creator. 
        
            Copyright infringement can vary on the extent on which you have breached the copyright law. The conviction of breaching copyright law
            can land you in either the magistrate court or crown court and conviction can range from 6 months to 10 years incareration and/or between Â£50,000 and unlimited fine depending 
            on the type of court you attend fine.
